# DataQuery-Hub

## Objective
The DataQuery-Hub project focuses on creating a relational database and simulating real-world data scenarios. It aims to enhance SQL skills by practicing data retrieval, filtering, joining tables, and performing calculations. The project provides hands-on experience in database management and query optimization, preparing participants for real-world data challenges.
